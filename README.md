# Deep Learning Nano Degree Project - CNN based image classification using CIFAR-10 dataset

The project makes use of convolutional neural network to train a classifier to classify airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We use the images from the CIFAR-10 dataset for training.

Datasets:
  * CIFAR-10 dataset

Libraries:
* Tensorflow
* NumPy
